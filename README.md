# Plant Disease Detection System

## Overview
The Plant Disease Detection System is an AI-powered application designed to classify plant diseases based on leaf images. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the system helps farmers and agriculturalists quickly identify and address plant health issues. The project uses an image classification model built with scikit-learn and is capable of detecting various diseases across multiple plant species.
